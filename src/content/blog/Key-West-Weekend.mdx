# Key West

## Day one

*Saw a street circus performer. He’s been here for five years according to his Venmo history.*

Day two:

Paddle boarding an inlet. Nurse sharks are nocturnal and rest during the day.

I found two lost jellyfish. 

Took a catamaran to the sand key lighthouse which has some amazing snorkeling.

Warm water, colorful fish and rocky coral. There weren’t the towering kelp forests of Catalina island, but the water wasn’t numbing cold. 

Accidentally ended up swimming with a bull shark. Might have swam after it which in hindsight wasn’t the best idea.

Day three:

Fort Zachary State Park

More fish sand and beach.
