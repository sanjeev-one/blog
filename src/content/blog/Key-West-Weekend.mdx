*Took a catamaran to the sand key lighthouse which has some amazing snorkeling.*

\*Warm water, colorful fish and rocky coral. There weren’t the towering kelp forests of Catalina island, but the water wasn’t numbing cold. \*

*Accidentally ended up swimming with a bull shark. Might have swam after it which in hindsight wasn’t the best idea.*
