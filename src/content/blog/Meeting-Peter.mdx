**Meeting Peter: What I Learned**

I had the pleasure of meeting Peter the other day, and I must say, I walked away with a few interesting insights. When I asked Peter what he did, I was taken aback by his response. "I enjoy playing in the monkey bars," he said with a smile. It was clear that Peter wasn't your average individual. I followed up by asking him about his education, and he mentioned that he attended Duke University. When I asked if they were good at basketball, he gave me a cryptic response: "Only on the weekends?" I wasn't entirely sure what to make of it, but it was clear that Peter was a unique individual with a sense of humor. Meeting Peter was a refreshing change of pace, and I appreciated his carefree attitude. 

**What I learned from Peter:** 

 Don't take yourself too seriously. Peter's response about playing in the monkey bars was a great reminder to not get too caught up in our daily routines. \* Education is important, but it's not everything. Peter's attendance at Duke University was impressive, but it was clear that he didn't let it define him. \* Humor can go a long way. Peter's witty response about Duke's basketball team was a great way to break the ice and show his personality. Overall, meeting Peter was a great experience, and I walked away with a few valuable lessons. It just goes to show that you can learn something new from anyone, no matter how brief the encounter may be.
