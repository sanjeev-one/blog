## Meeting Peter: Unconventional Insights from a Chance Encounter

As I walked into the room, I was immediately drawn to a man with an infectious smile and an air of confidence. His name was Peter, and little did I know that our brief conversation would leave me with some unconventional insights.\n\nThe Power of Play\n\nWhen I asked Peter what he did, I was taken aback by his response. "I enjoy playing in the monkey bars," he said with a grin. At first, I thought he was joking, but as I looked into his eyes, I realized he was dead serious. It was a refreshing reminder that play is not just for kids. In a world where we're constantly told to be productive and efficient, Peter's response was a breath of fresh air. It made me realize that taking time to play and have fun is essential to our well-being and creativity.\n\nThe Unconventional Student\n\nAs our conversation continued, I asked Peter what school he attended. "I go to Duke," he replied matter-of-factly. I was impressed, but what struck me was that Peter didn't seem to fit the mold of a traditional Duke student. He didn't talk about his grades or his coursework; instead, he seemed to embody a sense of freedom and joy. It made me realize that there's more to being a student than just academics. Peter's approach to education was a reminder that learning should be a holistic experience that nourishes our minds, bodies, and souls.\n\nThe Weekend Warrior\n\nFinally, I asked Peter if Duke was good at basketball. His response was cryptic: "Only on the weekends?" I'm still not entirely sure what he meant, but it made me think about the importance of balance in our lives. Are we only productive or successful during certain times of the week or month? Or can we find ways to bring our A-game every day? Peter's response was a reminder that we should strive to be our best selves, not just on the weekends or during certain hours of the day, but always.\n\nAs I parted ways with Peter, I couldn't help but feel grateful for our chance encounter. He may not have fit the mold of a traditional professional or student, but he taught me valuable lessons about the importance of play, balance, and living life on our own terms. Sometimes, it's the unconventional people we meet who have the greatest impact on our lives.
